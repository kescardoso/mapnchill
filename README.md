# Map & Chill <br>Yoga and Massage Locator in the Côte d'Azur

 **[View this website on GitHub Pages](https://kescardoso.github.io/ms2-mapnchill/)**

*Map & Chill is a Yoga and Massage Locator in the Côte d'Azur. It helps customers find the best yoga teachers and massage therapists so they can enjoy a healthy, relaxing break in the French Riviera.*

Map & Chill is my second milestone project for Code Institute: a geo-location-based website aimed at yoga and massage businesses and professionals around the beautiful South of France. Map & Chill consists of a lightweight, responsive static landing page mainly built on Bootstrap and the Google API. Below you will find my complete development process, from UX strategy to deployment. If you have any questions or if you require more details about my work, [please do get in touch](http://kescardoso.com/contact).

This project has both educational and entrepreneurial goals, and it features my skills on: programming, web development, graphic design, UX strategy and digital marketing.

Thanks for appreciating Map & Chill with me :)
